# How to run our plugins

Use **gradle run** command to execute the program.

Two of our data plugins need API keys to run.

The Advanced Daily Stock Data Plugin requires an API key from www.eodhistoricaldata.com and you can have up to 20 API requests every day with a free account. Replace the content of AdvancedDailyStockDataPlugin.txt under the hw5c/src/main/resources/API-KEY/ with your own API key.

The Federal Reserve Historical Economic Data plugin requires an API key from www.quandl.com and you need to input the API key to the pop up window when you run the plugin.
